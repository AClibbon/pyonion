      "Japan’s biggest airline has started offering luxury dining aboard a parked airplane titled the “winged restaurant,” for £390 a meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diners rushed to relive the cabin dining experience on Wednesday, despite being unable to travel due to the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "All Nippon Airways (ANA) is offering “passengers” a choice between a first-class seat with a meal for 59,800 yen (£391) and a business-class option for about half the price, at 29,800 yen, on board a stationary Boeing-777 at Haneda airport in Tokyo. They are asked to choose in advance from three menus: Japanese-style, western-style beef or western-style fish, served with wine.\n",

      "Yosuke Kimoto, 42, who had a business-class meal with his 14-year-old son, told Kyodo News: “It was a delicious meal. I’m glad that my kid enjoyed it too.” They were among 56 guests who had lunch aboard on the first day of the service.\n",
      "\n",
      "His son was also impressed. “The business class was drastically different from the economy class in terms of both food and the seat. It was so spacious, and the seat was like a bed when reclined,” he told Nikkei Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "ANA will offer 22 lunch and dinner sessions this month, each lasting about three hours. There is no in-flight entertainment, but customers receive amenity kits and can also use the airline’s lounge at Haneda’s domestic terminal.\n",

      "Singapore Airlines became the first carrier to tap into the public’s appetite for onboard dining last October, when it started offering meals on two A380 superjumbos parked at Changi airport in Singapore. Tickets sold out in less than half an hour, despite the £360 price tag for a business meal, with the chance to watch a movie too. Economy-class meals were more affordable at £30 a head.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pandemic has plunged the global aviation industry into its worst-ever crisis, as many aircraft around the world remain grounded amid coronavirus travel restrictions and lockdowns, prompting some airlines to think creatively about what to do with their idle aircraft. At ANA, the idea of the “winged restaurant” was reportedly thought up by employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "In-flight meals have been surprisingly popular. ANA started selling international economy-class meals online in December and they quickly sold out. It sold 264,000 meals and made revenues of £1.3bn as of 12 March. The airline said beef sukiyaki and hamburger steak with demi-glace sauce served with buttered rice and creamy scrambled eggs were gone within minutes.\n",

      "Prosecutors in Thailand have indicted five pro-democracy activists on charges of attempting to harm the queen during a street demonstration in October last year, in which some protesters shouted slogans critical of the monarchy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Queen Suthida, the wife of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, was not in any evident danger in the incident, which occurred when a limousine carrying the queen and the king’s son, Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, passed through a small crowd of protesters mixed with supporters of the royal family.\n",
      "\n",
      "The five are accused of violating section 110 of the criminal code, which says that whoever attempts an act of violence against the queen or the royal heir faces 16-20 years’ imprisonment. They include Ekachai Hongkangwan, a veteran activist and social critic who has been attacked several times by unknown assailants.\n",
      "\n",
      "All five deny any wrongdoing. After their indictment, they were released on bail of 200,000-300,000 baht ($6,400-$9,600) each.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is highly unusual for the royal family’s vehicles to be driven near protests. During the 14 October incident, police linked arms on either side of the queen’s car as it passed, keeping onlookers away. Some protesters shouted slogans critical of the monarchy, while monarchists countered with cries in support of the royal institution.\n",

      "\n",
      "Police broke up the rally late that night, and the next day declared a state of emergency for Bangkok which included a ban on unauthorised gatherings of more than five people. The ban was ignored and the state of emergency was rescinded shortly afterward.\n",
